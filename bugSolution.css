To solve the issue, we must understand that `!important` does not override specificity.  A more specific selector will always win.  To fix this, avoid relying on `!important` and restructure your CSS.  For instance, instead of relying on `!important`, increase the specificity of the desired style rule:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green !important; /*Now this is overriding other styles because it is the most specific*/
}
```

Alternatively, adjust your CSS structure to avoid the conflict and make your selectors more specific by considering the parent element to avoid using !important.

```css
.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```
