The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon bug related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}
```

In this case, the `!important` declaration on the `.child` selector is overridden by the more specific `.parent .child` selector which does not have `!important` flag.  This might be unexpected because the `!important` declaration typically overrides all other styles. However, specificity rules still apply.

The order of appearance within the CSS file does not affect the outcome because specificity decides the precedence.
